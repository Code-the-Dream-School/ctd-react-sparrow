## Similar to React JS managing variables state, TodoApp - TheMatrix helps to manage your state of mind when creating and managing your activity.  

My favorite movies help me to focus my mind and set me in a creative mode.
For enhancing visual effects, I can easily enlarge the movie images in a full-screen modal by clicking on them and on the top banner.
